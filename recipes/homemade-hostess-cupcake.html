    <h3>Chocolate Cupcake</h3>
    <p>These copycat Hostess cupcakes are a treat for all chocolate lovers: chocolate cupcakes filled with cream and topped with chocolate frosting and that signature white icing finish.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>Cupcakes</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups flour</li>
        <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Filling</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>¼ cup shortening</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Frosting</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup chocolate frosting</li>
        <li>¾ cup vanilla frosting</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 36 muffin cups with paper cups.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, white sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk, oil, water, and vanilla extract. Mix with an electric mixer at low speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Fill prepared muffin cups a little over half full (use a #20 or 3-tablespoon scoop).</li>
        <li>Bake until a toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean, 18 to 22 minutes. Transfer from pans to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for the filling, combine powdered sugar, butter, shortening, milk, vanilla extract, and a pinch salt in another large bowl. Using clean beaters, mix with an electric mixer at high speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Insert a large round tip into a pastry bag; fill with filling. Push tip through top of each cooled cupcake to fill; wipe excess frosting off to create a smooth top.</li>
        <li>Frost tops with chocolate frosting. Insert a small round tip into a clean pastry bag; fill with vanilla frosting. Pipe frosting across tops of cupcakes in loops. Transfer cupcakes to an airtight container. Store at room temperature up to 3 days or freeze up to 3 months.</li>
        <li>For a glimmering, smooth finish, put chocolate frosting in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave until pourable, about 20 seconds. Dip each cupcake top in warmed frosting.</li>
    </ol>
